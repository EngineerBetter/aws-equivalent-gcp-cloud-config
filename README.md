# aws-equivalent-gcp-cloud-config

Use this snippet of [BOSH Cloud Config](https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html) to allow you to spin up GCP VMs that are roughly equivalent to [AWS EC2 instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

Pull requests for additional types are most welcome.
